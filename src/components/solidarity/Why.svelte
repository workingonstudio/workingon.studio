      <p>Looking for work on is a nightmare. So is LinkedIn.</p>

        So you’ve just come off the call with HR and the person running your department. Closed the Zoom/Hangout/Teams
        window, then the countless others that have been logged out while you were on the call (this actually happened
        to me).
      </p>
      <p>
        You rush to your dusty LinkedIn profile and begin frantically updating your work experience. If you made an
        impression you’ll start receiving messages of support, details are passed on. You ask for references. But I mean
        who is really gonna be looking at those?
      </p>
      <p>
        But now the real work begins. You need to make it known that you are now #opentowork. This basically becomes the
        equivalent of getting under someone to get over someone. No time to grieve, no time to take stock of what you
        really want. Feeling dejected, could you have done more? Should I have said that?
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is, you’re probably getting let go for bullshit reasons way out of your control. The poor decisions
        made by those on a higher pay grade, but refuse to take accountability. If that number isn’t going up, they look
        down, not around.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I digress. The last part of the frantic update is adding the #opentowork banner. If you’re anything like me,
        you already had it set to “visible to recruiters only”. But now it’s visible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look I get it, it’s there for a reason. But my god does it feel shit. You’re already in a vulnerable state.
        Wondering where the next paycheque is going to come from, figuring out what you can cut back on. Goodbye
        Netflix, goodbye Amazon Prime, goodbye cheeky takeaway. Tipping, what’s that?
      </p>
      <p>
        You click it. LinkedIn asks if you want to post about it. 'Hey I’ve just been dumped, looking for…' Nah, not
        yet. You have faith. This will be quick. But then 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time you log in it’s there staring you in the face. #opentowork #opentowork #opentowork. That green disc
        hanging around your neck, your smiling face behind it. “Look at me, I’m so cheery, despite the absolute terror
        of not being able to pay my mortgage at the end of the month.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know about you but it sometimes seems like I’m the only one with it on. As I scroll the feed I see
        success, performance gloating, and countless tips of what I should be doing to get a better chance of finding
        work. How I should be presenting myself. Don’t do that, do this, no not this, that. Comment “help me I’m
        desperate” for my 10 page .pdf.
