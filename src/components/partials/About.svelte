    16 years shipping products. I've designed systems for millions of users and been part of 5 exits. I've worked across
    AI, marketing, finance, SaaS, just not gambling. Never gambling.

    I design and build, not just push pixels. I understand constraints, move fast, and don't need my hand held. I work
    best with teams that ship, not teams that meet about shipping.
