    16 years. Designed systems used by millions. Made millions for other people's companies. Touched every industry
    except gambling because f**k gambling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Managed. Planned. Created. Pushed fixes at 2am, fixed them at 9am. Made silly things in my spare time. Wrote about
    what's broken in design.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I'm building differently now. Products that work and make a point. No more extractive bulls**t dressed as
    "engagement".
  </p>
  <p>
    I work with teams that run on gut, not graphs. That ship fast and trust their designers (just don't drag me into
    every meeting).
