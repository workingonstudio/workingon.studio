    <p>To all,</p>
    <p>
      Look, I'm tired of products that pretend to solve problems while creating
      new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired of "user experiences" designed to extract rather than delight. Tired
      of the gap between what we say we're building and what we're actually
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I'm building cultural mirror products. Things that hold up what people
      are unconsciously doing and make them suddenly, uncomfortably aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not because I'm trying to fix broken systems. Because I'm meeting people
      where they are and changing how they interact with those systems.
    </p>
    <p>Cheers.</p>
