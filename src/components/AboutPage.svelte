    They're not users, they're not customers, they’re not clients, or partners, they're people. Messy humans, with issues far greater
    than &#x0022I'd best get this report done&#x0022.

    They’re humans that don’t need to be talked to like idiots. The world isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. They don’t
    need to be manipulated, told that if they just buy &#x0022this thing&#x0022 their life will be complete.

  <p>This is just a ride. And I’d much rather make it the best ride than trick them into thinking it is.</p>
  <p>So I'm building products that reflect that. Cultural mirrors. Things that make the invisible visible. Design that centers people, not conversion rates.</p>
