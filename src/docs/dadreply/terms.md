## 1. About Dad Reply

Dad Reply is a Chrome extension developed by workingon.studio that helps you send quick emoji responses to emails in Gmail. With just one click, you can reply with a üëç or other custom responses - because sometimes that's all you need to say.

We collect anonymous usage data to improve the service and may display aggregate statistics publicly.

These terms govern your use of Dad Reply ("the Service"). By installing or using Dad Reply, you agree to these terms.

## 2. How Dad Reply Works

Dad Reply adds a button to your Gmail interface that allows you to:
- Send quick emoji responses to emails
- Customize your response options
- Choose different skin tones for emoji
- Access Pro features (with a paid license)

**Important:** Dad Reply never sends emails automatically. Every response requires you to click the button - you're always in control.

When using Dad Reply, you agree to:

- **Use it appropriately** - Consider your workplace policies and professional relationships before sending emoji responses

- **Keep it legal** - Don't use Dad Reply for spam, harassment, or anything illegal

We provide the tool, but you decide how to use it. Use your Dad wisdom.
