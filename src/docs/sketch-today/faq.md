No one has asked these. I am just guessing at this point. But 'answers to questions you might have' doesn't have a good acronym.

> How much does this cost?

Free. Despite people pushing me to make this a paid affair. Because you know. That's what life is about right? Right? No it's free.

> Can I submit my own resources?

Not yet. Right now this is my mission. And I am the gatekeeper of this house. I'm not suggesting I won't open this up. But for now. It's a no from me Bob.

> Why did you create this?

Because I have an old Macbook. And right now running 3 tabs in design software burns my legs, and makes the fans blow harder than an OG PS4. So for the sake of my health, my legs, and my ears, I decided to give Sketch another go.

With that I needed some resources that I relied on. Mainly [Tailwind colors](/projects/sketch-today/palettes/tailwind/). That was the catalyst.

> Some of the resources are marked 'Soon' what's that about?

Because it's just me. You think I have all the time in the world. I am currently trying to get to a point where I am not eating beans from a can with a rusty fork.

> Can you prioritise a particular resource for me?

Yes. I can. But that won't be free. My day rate is Â£500, sound good? [Get in touch](/contact).

> Can I host these elsewhere?

Firstly why? Nothing is hosted here. They are either on Github, or they're on Sketch Workspaces. If you mean so you can generate ad revenue, then, no.
