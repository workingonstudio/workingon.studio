It's never about the software, it's the person that's using it. 

That's it. Right now the industry is leaning a particular way. But soon enough that too will turn. In waves people have adopted the new hotness.

Eventually prices will continue to rise. The limitations of browser based technology will remain sluggish. Those that used that software for one purpose will tire of updates not focusing on them. And they'll look for the next alternative, or maybe an older one?

### Coming back home.

[Sketch](https://sketch.com) has always had a special place in my heart. When I entered this hellscape that is design. I used [Fireworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Fireworks). It was a true vector based UI design software. I knew that software like the back of my hand. So once I got my first job at a design agency I was horrified to find that the tool of choice for design was [Photoshop](/).

After leaving, swiftly. I started freelancing. And then...[Sketch](/) launched.

Next came the golden era (gather round the stump of the lemon tree children). But design catapulted into the 21st century, with designers firmly at the helm. We had services created like Zeplin, Abstract and Invision (RIP).

### Creating the pieces.

One of the big problems that people face when switching to Sketch (or back to Sketch). Is that they become accustomed to having resources at their fingertips. 

Pre-built libraries, components, palettes, and plugins. And although these do exist for Sketch. Some, read most, are outdated. The expectation of being able to grab the latest copy of ShadCn is swifty put to rest on a simple Google search.

So here we are. This collection aims to be exactly that. A curated list of existing or freshly created libraries, components, palettes, and plugins. Compatible with the latest version of [Sketch](/).

It's your homecoming kit. Your chocolate on the pillow. You're complimentary blanket.

Enjoy.
