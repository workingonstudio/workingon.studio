It's never about the software, it's the person that's using it. 

That's it. Right now the industry is leaning a particular way. But soon enough that too will turn. In waves people have adopted the new hotness.

Eventually prices will continue to rise. The limitations of browser based technology will remain sluggish. Those that used that software for one purpose will tire of updates not focusing on them. And they'll look for the next alternative, or maybe an older one?

### It's difficult to come back.

One of the big problems that people face when switching to [Sketch](https://sketch.com) (or back to Sketch). Is that they become accustomed to having resources at their fingertips. 

Pre-built libraries, components, palettes, and plugins. And although these do exist for Sketch. Some, read most, are outdated. The expectation of being able to grab the latest copy of ShadCn is swifty put to rest on a simple Google search.

So I've taken it upon myself (some might say foolishly) to convert or create these resources. Each month I'll update the list of existing or freshly created libraries, components, palettes, and plugins. Which will be compatible with the latest version of [Sketch](https://sketch.com).

It's your homecoming kit. Your chocolate on the pillow. You're complimentary blanket.

Enjoy.
