To some, generally those employed, there can be a fear of your employer finding out (despite taking precautions). But to others it can be another weight around your neck, depending on your profile picture, when you find yourself in a position of unemployment.

As much as it makes you standout (as it's supposed to), it can often feel like the virtual sandwich board of a once successful stock broker just wanting to feed their family.

It can be this feeling that might deter those who really need to use it, to not.

The thing about the **#opentowork** banner is, although it allows you to stand out, it can quickly become a constant reminder of the position you are in. It's the food in someone's teeth that seems to get bigger every time they open their mouth. The more you look, the bigger it gets.

Every time you login, every time you post, every time you update your profile with the latest buzzwords it's there. A reminder, I'm looking for work, I need work.

## What can we do<span>?</span>

Well how about we harness the power of Exposure Therapy. The idea that if you can expose someone in a safe environment, to what they fear or worry about, they can gradually overcome it.

So…I'm calling it **Solidarity**.

This simple Chrome Extension, once toggled, gives you the illusion of every member on LinkedIn being **#opentowork**. Even Bill Gates.

That's it, no options, no settings. Just click.

It might sound silly, but it’s surprising how powerful this simple shift in perspective can be.

For those currently in this position, I hope it will help ease the journey. And others? Give it a shot, see how it feels.
