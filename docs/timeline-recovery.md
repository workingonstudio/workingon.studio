# Timeline Recovery Documentation

## What Happened
During development of the timeline feature, an accidental rebase cascade occurred that broke the chronological continuity we wanted to preserve. This document records the recovery process.

## The Problem
1. **Main branch was rebased** - losing authentic commit sequence and timestamps
2. **Dev branch was updated from rebased main** - cascading the timeline break
3. **Timeline feature couldn't show authentic development story** - the very transparency we were building for

## The Recovery Process

### Investigation
```bash
git reflog show main    # Found original timeline at main@{1}
git reflog show dev     # Found original work at dev@{2}
```

### Main Branch Recovery
```bash
git checkout main
git reset --hard main@{1}    # Restored to: a890f79 (tag: v1.1.0)
```

### Dev Branch Recovery  
```bash
git checkout dev
git reset --hard dev@{2}     # Restored to: 4db85b7 with authentic work
```

### GitHub Sync
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
git push --force-with-lease origin dev
```

## What Was Restored

### Main Branch Timeline
- Original meta-timeline-development branch work
- Proper merge commit showing feature integration  
- Authentic commit dates and development rhythm
- Real chronological sequence

### Dev Branch Timeline
- "Setting up dev branch" commit
- octocat-for-data-fetch feature branch work
- Timeline ordering and display fixes
- Built on authentic main branch foundation

## Philosophy
This recovery embodies our studio's core methodology: **making invisible processes visible**. Rather than hiding this mistake, we're documenting it as part of the authentic development story.

The irony is perfect - while building a feature to showcase transparent development, we accidentally broke the very timeline we wanted to preserve. The recovery process itself becomes part of the authentic story.

## Technical Impact
- ✅ Timeline feature now shows real development history
- ✅ No artificial rebase timestamps or ordering
- ✅ Proper feature branch integration story
- ✅ Authentic creative/technical process documentation
