Look, I'm tired of products that pretend to solve problems while creating new ones. Tired of "user experiences" designed to extract rather than delight. Tired of the gap between what we say we're building and what we're actually building.

So I'm building things differently.

## What I actually do.

I make cultural mirror products. Things that hold up what people are unconsciously doing and make them suddenly, uncomfortably aware of it.

[**Dad Reply**](https://www.producthunt.com/products/dad-reply) - Universal acknowledgment without engagement.

[**Solidarity**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ahahliplongfboaikbajdedefpoifjeb?utm_source=item-share-cb) - Everyone's looking for something.

**Design Dojo** - When creativity becomes competition.

**Only98** - How much will you spend to be truly unique?

**TypeDrop** - What does thinking cost?

Each one works. Each one also makes you think about why you needed it in the first place.

## The thing about this site.

Here's where it gets interesting.

Instead of hiding my messy development process behind polished marketing copy, I made it the centrepiece. See that "Last updated" timestamp? Click it.

You'll see every commit, every iteration, every small improvement. The actual development timeline, auto-generated from git commits. No sanitised "my process" nonsense—just the real process, visible and unfiltered.

Because transparency isn't just philosophy. It's practice.

## Why this matters.

I don't ask people to abandon existing systems. That's naive and ineffective. Instead, I meet them where they are and change how they interact with those systems.

Rather than preaching about digital wellness, I build Dad Reply. Instead of lecturing about LinkedIn's toxicity, I create Solidarity. I don't write manifestos about AI's environmental cost—I make TypeDrop.

Each product is both functional tool and cultural commentary, delivered through experience rather than explanation.

## How I work.

No compartmentalisation. The same methodology driving experimental projects shapes client work. A design studio crossed with a sociology lab where each release makes invisible dynamics suddenly apparent.

I don't just make things look good. I make things that make you question why they needed to exist at all.

## What's next.

Currently working on making the obvious visible. Working on centering people in technology. Working on finding delight in the mundane.

Always working on something.
